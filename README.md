## Key Concepts

Geocoding - "the process of converting addresses (like "1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA") into geographic coordinates (like latitude 37.423021 and longitude -122.083739), which you can use to place markers on a map, or position the map." -[Google](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/overview)

Reverse geocoding - "the process of converting geographic coordinates into a human-readable address." -[Google](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/overview)
