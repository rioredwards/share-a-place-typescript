# Share a Place Typescript

This app allows you to search for a place and share it with others. It uses the Google Maps API to get coordinates from an address and then renders a map with a marker on it. It uses a serverless function to get the coordinates from the address.

This was a practice project for learning Typescript. It was made by following [this tutorial](https://www.udemy.com/course/understanding-typescript/learn/lecture/16935782#content) on Udemy

## Key Concepts

Geocoding - "the process of converting addresses (like "1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA") into geographic coordinates (like latitude 37.423021 and longitude -122.083739), which you can use to place markers on a map, or position the map." -[Google](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/overview)
